Since I am using these solutions at work, home office and home, I need to constantly edit, pull/push to the github repository. Today, I encounter this warning from my home office macprob laptop:


##	my linux server

Solutions: 

The command "git config --global --edit" gives me the following and I am changing my email to see whether it solves the problem.

# This is Git's per-user configuration file.
[user]
# Please adapt and uncomment the following lines:
#       name = Jianying Li
#       email = jianying.li@gmail.com

##	somehow the error occurs again with message like the following:

(base) li11@almbp02012678 scRNAseqYouTuber % git commit -m "done for today's problem"
[main c0c2303] done for today's problem

    git config --global user.email you@example.com

After doing this, you may fix the identity used for this commit with:

    git commit --amend --reset-author

I follow the instruction, and it is fine now.

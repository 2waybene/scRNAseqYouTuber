For whatever reason, I can't find my note from yesterday, anyway, I start again and hopefully, I can document it well.

To switch/learn scanpy, I give credit to a few sources:

10x genomics -- velocity study
sanpy tutorial
AnnData
Sanbomics

I have a python virtual environment: scanpyBasic on ib01, and it works so far so good
I have access to niehs jupyterhub for most of the analysis

For Sanbomics, my working directory would be ~/project2024/scRNAseqShortCourse2024/ScanpySanbomics

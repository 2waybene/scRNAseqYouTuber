Today, I am checking out an old colleague's analysis history, 

I am attempt to activate her conda virtual enviroment by modifying my .condarc file

And, that seems to work, but there are installations that look for the python interpreter under her home directory that breaks the working link anyway.

So, good to know if something works and have to figure it out if they stop working.

One example would be the VEP that still not working for me, have to figure that out.

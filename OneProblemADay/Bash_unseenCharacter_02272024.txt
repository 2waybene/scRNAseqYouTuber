Often time, there are cases that although a file looks pretty normal, but if one opens it with an ascii base editor, he may see it. I encountered this long time ago and got a wordpress posting to document such process. I just came across with one, and feel that I need to do a more thorough research and document some solution.

I have a gene symbole list created from R (in windows) named: IntOGen_MDAnderson_union_DriverGenes_MusM.txt 

 
Here are some good solutions:

#Solution 1
cat IntOGen_MDAnderson_union_DriverGenes_MusM.txt  | tr -d '\015' > ANewFileWithoutSpecialChars.txt


#Solution 2, Important: To enter ^M, type CTRL-V, then CTRL-M

sed -e "s/^M//" filename > newfilename

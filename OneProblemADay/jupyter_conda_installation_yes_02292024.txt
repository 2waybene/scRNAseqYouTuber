Problem of the day:

I encountered a strange situation, I can import python package from command line, from ipython, but NOT from the jupyter notebook that using the same kernel.

Solution:

To examine this, I try to compare the results running the following commands in both ipython and in your jupyter notebook. 

 
import sys
print(sys.executable)
print(sys.path) 

I got different results, and most stunning difference is the sys.executable, apparently they are using different python interpreters!!!

So, I have to make the "jupyter" is the same. I end up invoking jupyter in the following manner:


~/miniconda3/envs/NSforest/bin/jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8889 --ip=0.0.0.0



##==========================================================================================
I am getting stuck installing [y/n] on Jupyter notebook, 

i.e. !conda install -c conda-forge biopython 

Answers:

Pass your "!pip install or !conda install somePackages" with command the keyword "--yes".

i.e. !conda install -c conda-forge biopython --yes

I know a lot of people may know this already, but I just figured this out and hopefully it’s helpful to somebody.


Side note:

One needs to make sure where python, jupyter are launched from, 

In [7]: import sys

In [8]: print(sys.executable)
/ddn/gs1/home/li11/miniconda3/envs/NSforest/bin/python3.8

In [9]: print(sys.path)

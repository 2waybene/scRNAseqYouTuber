There are just not that rosy with open source software. Now, I can't follow the tutorial for scanpy. I can't do sc.pl.violin with "mutli_panel=True)

It turns out it is the problem with seaborn, see the following


https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/issues/2680


Hey,

indeed there seems to be an issue with our current usage of seaborn, not working with seaborn 0.13.0.
This has been fixed on the main branch here, and we'll eventually take over the newest seaborn version once this is cleared.

For users running into this issue now

first check if you indeed have seaborn 0.13.0. If yes, then do
pip install seaborn==0.12.2 if using pip or
conda install seaborn=0.12.2 if using conda
this makes sure you are using the working version of seaborn.

Hope this helps!

And, once I downgradet the seaborn, 

scanpy can't be loaded!!

It then prompts me to down grade pandas, what a mess!!

The latest version of pandas 2.0.1 seems to not have is_categorical but instead it has is_categorical_dtype. Seems that in hic2cool, pandas version is not pinned to the one that has that.

I suggest installing a previous version of pandas before the changes took place.

Or install a newer version of cooler as they updated their library to use is_categorical_dtype

I solve the problem by downgrading the pandas == 1.5.3

In the mean time, I want to start a new python virtual environment!!!
